  abstract = {Non-commercial chickens may be the third most numerous pets in Western countries. Yet, to date, there is limited research into their welfare or the care-taking practices and attitudes of their guardians. Using a quantitative questionnaire, this study investigated non-commercial chicken owners' care-taking practices, attitudes, and relationship types with their chickens. Additionally, the study investigated barriers to optimizing non-commercial chicken welfare. Specific questions were asked regarding niche care-taking practices, including the use of Suprelorin{\textregistered} implants. With 2000+ responses, this study found variable care-taking practices, yet largely positive attitudes towards chickens, and a ``personal'' (though not ``close personal'') owner--chicken relationship, as defined by the Owner--Bird Relationship Scale. The Chicken Attitude Scale, Owner--Bird Relationship Scale, and Care Series scores were found to be correlated with each other, with coefficients ranging from 0.176 to 0.543 (p {$<$} 0.001). ``Preventing commercial chickens from going to slaughter'' was a key motive for chicken care by 56.1\% of respondents, with 69.6\% of respondents stating they cared for ex-commercial chickens. This study found a higher prevalence of reported poor health conditions and number of deaths relative to prior studies, and egg yolk peritonitis emerged as a leading health condition and cause of death. Moreover, 68.0\% had not heard of Suprelorin{\textregistered} implants, and only 6.3\% used implants. Most (76.4\%) chicken carers followed an omnivorous diet that includes chicken meat/eggs. The results reinforced previous findings concerning a need for more avian-specialist, locally available, and affordable veterinary care for chickens. Research into Suprelorin{\textregistered} implants, rooster-specific care, and tailored requirements of caring for ex-commercial chickens is recommended.},
