  abstract = {Habitat conversion and the expansion of domesticated, invasive species into native habitats are increasingly recognized as drivers of pathogen emergence at the agricultural--wildlife interface. Poultry agriculture is one of the largest subsets of this interface, and pathogen spillover events between backyard chickens and wild birds are becoming more commonly reported. Native wild bird species are under numerous anthropogenic pressures, but the risks of pathogen spillover from domestic chickens have been historically underappreciated as a threat to wild birds. Now that the backyard chicken industry is one of the fastest growing industries in the world, it is imperative that the principles of biosecurity, specifically bioexclusion and biocontainment, are legislated and implemented. We reviewed the literature on spillover events of pathogens historically associated with poultry into wild birds. We also reviewed the reasons for biosecurity failures in backyard flocks that lead to those spillover events and provide recommendations for current and future backyard flock owners.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive understanding of common diseases of backyard poultry flocks is important to providing poultry health information to flock owners, veterinarians, and animal health officials. We collected autopsy reports over a 3-y period (2015--2017) from diagnostic laboratories in 8 states in the United States; 2,509 reports were collected, involving autopsies of 2,687 birds. The primary cause of mortality was categorized as infectious, noninfectious, neoplasia or lymphoproliferative disease, or undetermined. Neoplasia or lymphoproliferative disease was the most common primary diagnosis and involved 42\% of the total birds autopsied; 63\% of these cases were diagnosed as Marek's disease or leukosis/sarcoma. Bacterial, parasitic, and viral organisms were commonly detected, involving 42\%, 28\%, and 7\% of the birds autopsied, respectively, with 2 or more organisms detected in 69\% of birds. Our findings demonstrate the importance of educating flock owners about disease prevention and biosecurity practices. The detection of zoonotic bacteria including paratyphoid salmonellae, Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Mycobacterium avium, and the detection of lead and other heavy metals, indicate public health risks to flock owners and consumers of backyard flock egg and meat products.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Although it has become increasingly popular to keep backyard chickens in the United States, few studies have provided information about these flocks. An online survey of backyard chicken owners was conducted, advertised through Master Gardeners' websites, social platforms, and other sites. The survey had 56 questions about flock history, husbandry, health care, and owner attitudes and demographics. Surveys received (n = 1,487) came almost equally from urban, suburban, and rural areas. Most (71\%) respondents owned fewer than 10 chickens and had kept chickens for less than 5 yr (70\%). Major reasons for keeping chickens were as food for home use (95\%), gardening partners (63\%), pets (57\%), or a combination of these. Rural respondents had larger flocks (P {$\leq$} 0.001) and were more likely to keep chickens as a source of income or for show (P {$\leq$} 0.001) than urban and suburban respondents. owners thought that eggs/meat from their chickens were more nutritious (86\%), safer to consume (84\%), and tasted better (95\%) than store-bought products, and also that the health and welfare of their chickens was better (95\%) than on commercial farms. The majority (59\%) indicated no flock health problems in the last 12 mo. However, there was a lack of awareness about some poultry health conditions. Many knew either little or nothing about exotic Newcastle or Marek's disease, and most (61\%) did not vaccinate against Marek's. Respondents wanted to learn more about various flock management topics, especially how to detect (64\%) and treat (66\%) health problems. The Internet was the main source of information (87\%) used by backyard flock owners, followed by books/magazines (62\%) and feed stores (40\%). Minimizing predation was the most cited challenge (49\%), followed by providing adequate feed at low cost (28\%), dealing with soil management (25\%), and complying with zoning regulations (23\%). The evidence obtained from this survey will help to determine what information and resources are needed to maintain good biosecurity and improve the health and welfare of backyard flocks.},

  abstract = {Suppose that animals have rights. If so, may you go down to your local farm store, buy some chicks, raise them in your backyard, and eat their eggs? You wouldn't think so. But we argue, to the contrary, that you may. Just as there are circumstances in which it's permissible to liberate a slave, even if that means paying into a corrupt system, so there are circumstances in which it's permissible to liberate chickens by buying them. Moreover, we contend that restrictions on freedom of movement can be appropriate for chickens, but not humans, because of the obvious differences between the interests of healthy, adult humans versus those of chickens who have been bred for human use. We also argue that egg consumption is permissible based on the plausible assumption that no one's rights are violated in their consumption, and so while there may sometimes be morally preferable uses for eggs, you do nothing unjust in eating them. If we're right, then the rights view doesn't imply that veganism is obligatory; rather, it implies that the constraints on how we source animal products, though highly demanding, are not so demanding that they can't be met.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The concept of backyard poultry historically encompassed ``food-producing animals.'' Nevertheless, a recent shift in livestock production paradigms within developed countries is evident, as backyard poultry owners now raise their birds for purposes beyond self-consumption, raising animals in a familiar way, and fostering emotional bonds with them. Because backyard animals are frequently privately owned, and the resulting products are typically not marketed, very little information is available about the demographic profile of backyard owners and information on flocks' characteristics, husbandry, and welfare. Thus, this review aims to clarify the characteristics of backyard poultry, highlighting the prevalent infectious diseases and the zoonotic risk to which farmers are exposed. According to the FAO, there are different types of poultry production systems: intensive, subintensive, and extensive. The system conditions, requirements, and the resulting performance differ extensively due to the type of breed, feeding practices, prevalence of disease, prevention and control of diseases, flock management, and the interactions among all these factors. The presence and transmission of infectious diseases in avian species is a problem that affects both the animals themselves and public health. Bacterial (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Mycoplasma), parasitic (helminths, louses, and mites), and viral (Avian influenza, Newcastle, Marek, Infectious Bronchitis, Gumboro, Infectious Laringotracheitis, and Fowlpox) are the most important pathogens involved in backyard poultry health. In addition, Avian influenza, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli, could be a risk for backyard farmers and/or backyard-derived products consumers. Thus, proper biosecurity implementation measures are mandatory to control them. While the principles and practices of onfarm biosecurity may be well-versed among commercial farmers, hobbyists, and backyard farmers might not be familiar with the necessary steps to protect their flocks from infectious diseases and curb their transmission. This sector represents the fourth category of poultry farming, characterized by the lowest biosecurity standards. Consequently, it is imperative to address the legal status of backyard poultry, educate owners about biosecurity measures, and promote proper veterinary care and disease control.},

  abstract = {Non-commercial chickens may be the third most numerous pets in Western countries. Yet, to date, there is limited research into their welfare or the care-taking practices and attitudes of their guardians. Using a quantitative questionnaire, this study investigated non-commercial chicken owners' care-taking practices, attitudes, and relationship types with their chickens. Additionally, the study investigated barriers to optimizing non-commercial chicken welfare. Specific questions were asked regarding niche care-taking practices, including the use of Suprelorin{\textregistered} implants. With 2000+ responses, this study found variable care-taking practices, yet largely positive attitudes towards chickens, and a ``personal'' (though not ``close personal'') owner--chicken relationship, as defined by the Owner--Bird Relationship Scale. The Chicken Attitude Scale, Owner--Bird Relationship Scale, and Care Series scores were found to be correlated with each other, with coefficients ranging from 0.176 to 0.543 (p {$<$} 0.001). ``Preventing commercial chickens from going to slaughter'' was a key motive for chicken care by 56.1\% of respondents, with 69.6\% of respondents stating they cared for ex-commercial chickens. This study found a higher prevalence of reported poor health conditions and number of deaths relative to prior studies, and egg yolk peritonitis emerged as a leading health condition and cause of death. Moreover, 68.0\% had not heard of Suprelorin{\textregistered} implants, and only 6.3\% used implants. Most (76.4\%) chicken carers followed an omnivorous diet that includes chicken meat/eggs. The results reinforced previous findings concerning a need for more avian-specialist, locally available, and affordable veterinary care for chickens. Research into Suprelorin{\textregistered} implants, rooster-specific care, and tailored requirements of caring for ex-commercial chickens is recommended.},

  abstract = {Approximately 3 billion people were unable to afford a healthy diet in 2019 because of poverty and inequality. Most of these people live in Asia and Africa. Furthermore, 30\% of the world population was affected by moderate to severe food insecurity in 2020, and most of this population lives in low- and middle-income countries. The world is at a critical juncture, and there is an urgent need for transformative food systems that ensure the empowerment of poor and vulnerable population groups, often smallholders with limited access to resources or those living in remote locations, as well as the empowerment of women, children, and youth (FAO,               2018               ). The backyard poultry production system (BPPS), as practiced by 80\% of the world's rural population, can be that transformative change in low- and middle-income countries. Although the BPPS has low productivity, it still plays an important role in the food and nutritional security of rural people living in fragile ecosystems. Backyard poultry has been recognized as a tool for poverty alleviation and women empowerment besides ensuring food and nutritional security for rural poor. Poultry meat and eggs are the cheapest and best source of good quality protein, minerals, and vitamins. The introduction of improved backyard poultry germplasm has improved the productivity of this system in resource-poor settings and thereby improved the income and nutritional security of poor households. With these birds, the availability, access, utilization, and stability of food security have improved at household and national levels. Diseases, predation, non-availability of improved germplasm, lack of access to markets, and lack of skills are the major constraints to the adoption of improved backyard poultry. These constraints can be addressed by involving a network of community animal service providers. The improved backyard poultry germplasm will dominate the backyard poultry production system in the future and will be a tool for ensuring food and nutritional security on a sustainable basis, more particularly in low- and middle-income countries.},
