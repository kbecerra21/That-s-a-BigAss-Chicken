abstract: "This and fi l e shows the basic format for a Quarto notebook using the
'apaquarto' extension, which provides a template for APA style manuscripts. The
YAML header includes some properties that will be commonly used, but there are
many more options. The body of the notebook includes markdown text and code
chunks, and references can be included using a BibTeX file. When the document is
rendered, the output will be rendered in APA style."

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
