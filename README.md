# Chicken analysis plan
We can look at chicken age and diet as a predictor of chicken weight.
We can do this in a bunch of different ways. We can put chicken age (time) as a continuous variable on the x-axis, chicken weight on the y-axis, and do individual line plots that corresponds to changes in weight as a function of time with each chicken.
If we want to get even more complicated, we can bin the chickens according to the type of diets they use, and obtain the mean growth rates for each chicken across different quartile ranges (and plot those results). So we can basically do... chickens with diet '1' have a mean end weight of... and the growth interval every two days is an average like... 3 pounds. Then we can do the same for the chickens with the other diets, and compare differences between groups to assess whether one diet has higher growth/end weights than the others.
